- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @monsterlokomotiv
- A software developer from Sweden with interests in programming, gaming and cooking (like a majority of developers, am I right?!). 
- My main area in languages are C# and SQL. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring a bit more of alternative .NET frameworks (compared to what I work with at my current workplace).
